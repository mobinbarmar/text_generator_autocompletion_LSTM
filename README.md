# text_generator_autocompletion_LSTM
o	Challenge: Efficiently predicting the next word or phrase in a text input, improving typing speed and reducing errors. This is especially crucial in mobile devices or complex writing tasks where each keystroke counts. 

o	Solution: Implement an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to learn patterns and context within large text datasets, enabling real-time, accurate text predictions and autocompletions.

o	Tools: Tensorflow, keras, NLTK, Numpy, pandas, Python, Jupyter Notebook
